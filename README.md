# Diogo's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my Arch Linux setup.

## Installation

Clone the repo and use stow (or create symlinks) to link to the correct directories.

### Ignored files

Below is a list of the files that are in `.gitignore`
(because they might contain sensitive information) and how to configure them.

- `awesome/.config/awesome/configuration/config.lua`: sample in `config.sample.lua`
- `awesome/.config/awesome/configuration/user-profile/*.png`: picture for theme; file name must match username
